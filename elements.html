								<h2>Detection of C type Solar Flares</h2>
<p>I am engaged in a rigorous and ongoing research project focused on the analysis of X-ray light curves derived from cutting-edge solar observation instruments aboard the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter (XSM). My primary research objective is the detection of C type solar flares. To achieve this, I am analysing the lightcurves and parametrising fit-models which can fit the lightcurves and identify C type solar flares. This initiative represents our unwavering commitment to advancing our understanding of the dynamic behavior of our Sun.</p>

<h2>Exploring Radiative Processes using Radio Astronomy</h2>
<p>My primary objective was to develop a comprehensive understanding of radio astronomy by exploring its foundational concepts and applying them to analyze data collected from radio telescopes using CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications) software. The project focused on hands-on learning, delving into the principles underlying radio astronomy and utilizing CASA to process and interpret data obtained from radio telescopes. The results were effectively understood through appropriate plots. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16CdyfGZnOOtjqoNibh9bUApAE7V2JPfq/view?usp=sharing">This report</a> provides a comprehensive learning experience that enabled me to gain proficiency in the fundamental aspects of radio astronomy and its data analysis techniques, with a specific focus on CASA software as a powerful tool for radio astronomical research.</p>

<h2>STUDY OF BLACK HOLES IN D-DIMENSIONS</h2>
<p>Special Acknowledgments to Prof. Rahul Nigam for guiding me with this project. First, proficient understanding of special relativity, including Lorentz transformations, time dilation, length contraction, and the concept of spacetime was done. Next, I learned how to visualize events using Minkowski and spacetime diagrams, and comprehensive knowledge of the spacetime interval and its invariance. Next, I grasped solid comprehension of gravitation, including the Schwarzschild metric, enabling the analysis of curved spacetime and gravitational effects. This allowed me to understand various important phenomena such as: perturbations in spacetime, Einstein's field equations, etc. You can find an attached report <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PAyoPJUOHQ9A9lhH5RwU1WQUqGHz6yh1/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

									<h1>MY INTERESTS</h1>

								

									<h4>President of AD ASTRA Club</h4>
									<p>AD ASTRA is the Astronomy and Astrophysics club of BITS Hyderabad. I am currently the president of the club. We actively participate in a multitude of captivating events including regular stargazing sessions and engaging projects that encompasses a wide spectrum of activities. Our projects range from immersive hands-on experiments such as Radio Astronomy using Horn Antennas, to data driven investigations that unveil intriguing. 
										I am very committed to this role as I enjoy being a leader and taking up responsibility
										in making the knowledge of Astronomy and Astrophysics available to all.  </p>
									<hr />

									<h4>Singing</h4>
										<p>I have been the lead singer in two of the major events in College. I 
											am involved in singing since I was in 3rd grade. Singing has always been a 
											stress burster for me. 
										 </p>

										 <hr />

										 <h4>Public Speaking</h4>
										 <p>I am very enthusiastic about public speaking. The key perks of being the President of
											the Astronomy club of BITS Hyderabad is the chance to get on a stage and speak to a crowd.
											I have also given a talk (online) in Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai on Neutron Star Merger Remnants
											(You can see it right <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6CWs5exS4Q">here</a>
											)

										  </p>

										  <hr />

										  <h4>Website for Aspiring Astrophysicists</h4>
										  <p> I've developed a website that serves as a central hub for astrophysics resources.
											 It's designed to welcome enthusiasts of all ages and provide them with an accessible starting point for exploring astronomy
											 and astrophysics. The link to the website is right <a href="https://sites.google.com/hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in/astrophysicsbyatreyi/home?authuser=0">here</a>
 
										   </p>

										   <hr />
									
										   <h4>Book on Basic Astrophysics</h4>
										   <p> I had always dreamed of becoming an author as I was addicted to reading Enid Blyton books 
											in my primary classes. The dream soon evolved to writing a knowledgable book for people of any 
											age. That's when I started writing a basic guide to Astrophysics targeted for young adults.
